Project: What are meaningful determinants of Cardiovascular Disease?
Contributors: Max Brant, Ramiz Khan, Lindsey Starkman, Vincent Wang

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally, and the economic burden of CVD in Canada is about $30 billion per year. The incidence of CVD is heavily influenced by demographic factors, risk factors/preexisting medical conditions, and behavioural factors.

In this project, we evaluated a supervised learning algorithm on the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Predition Dataset (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset), an open-source dataset of health-related telephone surveys including data about health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services for US residents (N = 308855).
